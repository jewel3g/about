    summary: `
      I am MD Anaet Ullah, a dedicated and detail-oriented Embedded Systems Engineer with 4 years of experience in designing, developing, and testing microcontroller-based systems. 
      Skilled in embedded C/C++, analog and digital circuit design, and working with STM32 microcontrollers. Passionate about creating reliable and high-quality solutions for real-world applications.

      <br /><br />

      My career began at <u>Vectoflow GmbH</u> as an Electronics Development Engineer, where I designed aerospace/industrial electronic components and ensured compliance with DO-160 and MIL standards.
      I specialized in EMC testing according to CISPER and ICE standards, while troubleshooting hardware/firmware issues to improve product reliability.

      <br /><br />

      At <u>Solarnative GmbH</u> as an Embedded System Developer, I focused on microcontroller firmware development, micro-inverter optimization, and wireless communication interfaces (LTE, LoRa).
      I also conducted hardware validation using advanced lab equipment including spectrum analyzers and oscilloscopes.

      <br /><br />

      As an <u>IoT Engineer at Code 19</u>, I led full-cycle IoT product development from concept to deployment, including prototyping, architecture design, and developing plug-and-play industrial IoT solutions.
      My expertise includes power electronics systems design with AC/DC, DC/AC, and DC/DC converters.

      <br /><br />

      I hold a <b>B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering</b> from <u>Daffodil International University</u> and a <b>Diploma in Electrical Engineering</b> from <u>Chittagong Polytechnic Institute</u>.
      My technical skills span bare-metal & RTOS firmware development, high-speed PCB design, EMC/EMI testing, and working with tools like KiCAD, Altium, and LTspice.

      <br /><br />

      With a proven track record in embedded systems and IoT solutions, I bridge the gap between hardware and software to create innovative technological solutions.
